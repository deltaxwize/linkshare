## How Invite Links Work

- **Normal Link**:  
  `/channelpost` gives you a deep link. When a user clicks it and starts the bot, they get a one-time, time-limited invite link.

- **Request Link**:  
  `/reqpost` gives you a deep link. When a user clicks it and starts the bot, they get a join request link (admin approval required).

- **All links are unique per user and expire after use or after 10 minutes.**
